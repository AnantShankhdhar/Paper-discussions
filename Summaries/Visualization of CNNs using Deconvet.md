# Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks
by Matthew D. Zeiler

## Overview
* Introduces a novel visualization technique that gives insight into the function of intermediate feature layers and the operation of the classifier.
* Describes the use of a Deconvolutional Neural Network to reconstruct feature maps in the input space.
* Performs an ablation study to discover the performance contribution from different model layers.
* Techniques used in the paper were used to improve performance of Image Net to give state-of-the-art results on Caltech-101 and Caltech-256 datasets.
